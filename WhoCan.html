           <h3>Most people can give <b class="bld">blood</b> if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a <b class="bld">blood</b> donor.  Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:</h3><br><br>
           <h2><img src="Resources/Images/ico/age.png" height="20px"><b> Age:</b></h2>
           <p>1. You are aged between 18 and 65.</p>
           <p>* In some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.</p>
           <p>* In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The upper age limit in some countries are 60.</p><br>
           
           <h2><img src="Resources/Images/ico/weight.png" height="20px"><b> Weight:</b></h2>
           <p>1. You weigh at least 50 kg. </p>
           <p>* In some countries, donors of whole <b class="bld">blood</b> donations should weigh at least 45 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10% .</p><br>

           <h2><img src="Resources/Images/ico/health.png" height="20px"><b> Health:</b></h2>
           <p>1. You must be in good health at the time you donate.</p>
           <p>2. You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.</p>
           <p>3. If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.  If the body piercing was performed by a registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate <b class="bld">blood</b> after 12 hours.</p>
           <p>4. If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.</p>
           <p>You must not donate <b class="bld">blood</b> If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for <b class="bld">blood</b> donation.</p>
           <p>* A test will be administered at the donation site. In many countries, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for males as the threshold.</p><br>

           <h2><img src="Resources/Images/ico/travel.png" height="20px"><b> Travel:</b></h2>
           <p>1. Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral .</p>
           <p>2. Many countries also implemented the policy to defer <b class="bld">blood</b> donors with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified countries or areas, as a measure to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by <b class="bld">blood</b> transfusion.</p><br>

           <h2><img src="Resources/Images/ico/behaviour.png" height="20px"><b> Behaviour:</b></h2>
           <p>1. You must not give <b class="bld">blood</b> :</p>
           <p>1.1 If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months</p>
           <p>1.2 Individuals with behaviours below will be deferred permanently : </p>
           <p>1.2.1 Have ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus)</p>
           <p>1.2.2 Have ever injected recreational drugs.</p>
           <p>* In the national <b class="bld">blood</b> donor selection guidelines, there are more behavior eligibility criteria. Criteria could be different in different countries.</p><br>

           <h2><img src="Resources/Images/ico/preg.png" height="20px"><b> Pregnancy and breastfeeding:</b></h2>
           <p>1. Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the pregnancy.</p>
           <p>2. It is not advisable to donate <b class="bld">blood</b> while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least 9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your baby is significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).</p>
